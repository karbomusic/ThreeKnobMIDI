## ThreeKnobMIDI

Three knob MIDI controller for Arduino. This is a simple controller for basic automation/editing needs. It is not intened to be a full-featured controller. The intial need was that I wanted a separate Zoom/Scroll controllers on big knobs to keep mouse use down for those actions. The third knob is for writing automation (usually) and I just "learn" the CC/parameter I need at the time.

This uses/requires Ardunino Pro Micro due to it's native USB ability which allows advertising the device as a MIDI device in Windows. All three knobs can be MIDI Learned by most DAWs or apps that have a MIDI CC learn function.
